# Civilization V Leaders
##### by Kenneth Black

A Reference Page for Civilization V with all of the available leaders in the base game and DLCs that shows each leader's unique ability, units, and buildings. I made this because I found myself referencing multiple sites to get my information on civs as the multiplayer in-game interface doesn't have any of this information and the sites I found only had partial information.
